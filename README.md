OVERVIEW

 

The importace of placement system is increasing day by day. Thousands of applicants are depending placement cell. But the applicants are facing so many problems. This project is an attempt to minimize the problems of an applicant to find a correct job. If we can make it an online computerized and a mobile alert process it will be so fast and convenient for the applicants.Far from upsetting matters, however, new technologies have predominantly made life better and considerably easier for most 0people, and so it must be concluded that they should be welcomed.

Software does not require a dedicated computer and can be run on almost any PC running Windows OS The package includes the MOB JOBS software and a normal cell phone and data cable. It uses a normal SIM card from a GSM operator with a local mobile number. In functionality it is similar to the four digit short codes but unlike short codes that is billed according to the agreement between the content provider and the service provider and can only be reached from certain networks a long code (Local GSM number) can be accessed from almost anywhere in the world for the price of an Normal SMS depending on location and tariff of the Local GSM operator.

EXISTING SYSTEM

 

The existing system is a manual system of limitations like accuracy, expense, low speed and efficiency and unformatted outputs. In the existing system, all data processing is done manually. All the files and record books are replaced by the software system. When there are a lot of issues such as retrieval and storage of the information and keeping track of them becomes a tedious task. By implementing a computerized system, the limitation in the present system will be reduced. Manpower can be reduced to a great extent and efficiency and accuracy can be increased to manifold. More over consumption of time can be reduced to far greater extend by the implementation of the proposed system.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

 

In the proposed system we propose to computerize the above-mentioned activities. In the existing system, all data processing is done manually. When there are a lot of issues such as retrieval and storage of the information and keeping track of them becomes a tedious task. By implementing a computerized system, the limitation in the present system will be reduced. Manpower can be reduced to a great extent and efficiency and accuracy can be increased to manifold. More over consumption of time can be reduced to far greater extend by the implementation of the proposed system.
